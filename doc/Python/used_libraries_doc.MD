### Python libraries used in this project

---

#### NumPy

NumPy short for Numerical Python is a library for Python supporting large,
multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. In addition it also has a large, high-level
mathematical function collection designed to work on these specific arrays.

##### Features

- fast, precompiled functions for numerical routines
- array oriented computing (better accuracy)
- supports object-oriented approach
- compact and fast computations with vectorization

##### Applications of NumPy

- data analysis
- N-dimensional array creation
- serves as a base for other libraries like SciPy and scikit-learn
- can replace MATLAB if it's used with matplotlib and SciPy

---

#### Pandas

Pandas or Python data analysis library is a cornerstone of data science when we talk about python.
Heavily used in the daily data science life for analysis and cleaning, also provides fast and flexible
data structures.

##### Features

- rich functionalities (to deal also with missing data)
- self-describing syntax
- high-level abstraction
- high-level manipulation tools and data structures

##### Applications

- handling and cleaning data
- ETL (extract-transform-load) jobs that include data transformation and load
- time-series specific needs (date range generation, date shifting, linear regression, moving window)
- academic and commercial usage as well

#### SciPy

Is a free and open-source Python library for scientifical and technical purposes as its name shows (Scientific Python).
It extends the functionality of the NumPy library while providing a user-friendly and efficient way to handle
scientific computations.

##### Features

- algorithm and function collection extending NumPy functionality
- provides high-level commands for manipulating and visualizing data
- offers multi-dimensional image processing
- has built in modules to solve differential equations

##### Applications

- multi-dimensional image operations
- for differential equations and Furier transform
- optimization algorithms
- linear algebra

#### Scikit-Learn

Is a free Python library made to be used for Machine Learning. Scikit-learn is designed to be interpolated into NumPy and SciPy.

##### Features

- wide variety of algorithms (SVM, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means, DBSCAN)
- integrates well with other libraries (specifically Matplotlib, Plotly, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy)
- offers great number of performance metrics (accuracy, r^2 score, receiver operating curve, precision-recall curve)

##### Applications

- clustering
- regression
- classification
- model selection
- dimensionality reduction
