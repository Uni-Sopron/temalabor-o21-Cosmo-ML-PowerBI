## Python libraries for Machine Learning

### NumPy

### Pandas

### Scikit-Learn

Performance metrics for models include accuracy, r^2 score, roc curve, precision-recall curve, etc.

### SciPy

### Theano

### NLTK

The Natural Language Toolkit, or more commonly NLTK, is a suite of libraries and programs for
symbolic and statistical natural language processing (NLP) for English. Since we are mainly working with
forecasting based on numbers and dates it is out of the question for us.

### LightGBM

### Eli5

It's a good tool to understand the models, their performance and their predictions
but lacks the ability to be used as a stand alone solution for machine learning.

It can be used for the libraries listed below:

- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- CatBoost
- Keras
- lightning
- LightGBM
- sklearn-crfsuite

### Spark MLib

### MXNet

### Keras

### TensorFlow

### Pytorch
